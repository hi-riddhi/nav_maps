# ARNav
*Navigating indoor spaces with help of Augumented Reality*

Navigating complex indoor spaces such as college 
campuses can be overwhelming, particularly for new students 
or visitors unfamiliar with the layout. The proposed system 
explores the development of a mobile AR (Augmented Reality) 
indoor navigation assistant: ARNAV designed specifically for a 
college campus environment and leverages a markerless vision
based system, eliminating the need for physical markers and 
offering a more flexible and adaptable navigation experience. 

This system utilizes image recognition technology to identify 
locations and trigger relevant information or directions as users 
navigate the environment. 
The steps involved in development of 
the project are Mapping, Localization and Visualization. 

1. Mapping: This includes acquiring data (3D models) and 
creating point clouds and data models.
2. Localization: Finding 
position in multiple point clouds and wayfinding. 
3. Visualization: Designing UI, visualizing paths.
 
The aim of the ARNAV project 
is to improve the user experience and interaction, support 
exploration and navigation in the college environment. 

# Work - Flow

# Working Model

The working model is an android application made through 
Unity. It had 3 panels for: path visualization switching and 
line visibility , debug option to change the height of the path 
indicator and change floor option.

ARNAV utilizes 3-D space recognition techniques, which 
eliminates the need for physical markers and offers greater 
flexibility. We created a 3D model from the college 
campus layout, by integrating AR technology, users will be 
able to choose their destination and our application so that the 
navigation experience becomes more immersive and 
interesting.
